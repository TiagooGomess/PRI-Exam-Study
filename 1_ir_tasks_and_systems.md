# IR Tasks and Systems

## What is the difference between information retrieval and data retrieval?

-   Data retrieval: the task of determining which documents of a collection contain the keywords in the user query.
-   Data retrieval system
    -   Ex: relational databases
    -   Deals with data that has a well defined structure and semantics
    -   A single erroneous object among a thousand retrieved objects means total failure
-   Data retrieval does not solve the problem of retrieving information about a subject or topic

## Give examples of IR and data retrieval systems

-   Data retrieval system
    -   Ex: relational databases
    -   Deals with data that has a well defined structure and semantics
    -   A single erroneous object among a thousand retrieved objects means total failure
-   IR system
    -   Web search is today the most prominent application of IR and its techniques
    -   The ranking and indexing components of any search engine are fundamentally IR pieces of technology

## Give some examples of retrieval tasks evaluated in TREC

-   TREC is organized into tracks, such as Fair Ranking, Precision Medicine, and Conversational Assistance.
-   Each track provides a corpus of documents and 1-2 tasks: defined information retrieval tasks that participants build systems to address.
-   The tasks usually provide a set of queries (called topics), and participants submit their system's responses to the queries.
-   The task organizers then evaluate these responses and score each submission.
-   Within this structure, the precise details can vary from track to track and year to year.

## What are the modules of an IR system?

Components of a traditional information retrieval system experiment include the:

-   Indexing system - indexing and searching methods and procedures (an indexing system can be human or automated)
-   Collection of documents - text, image or multimedia documents, or document surrogates (for example, bibliographical records)
-   Defined set of queries - which are input into the system, with or without the involvement of a human searcher
-   Evaluation criteria - specified measures by which each system is evaluated, for example 'precision' and 'recall' as measures of relevance.
