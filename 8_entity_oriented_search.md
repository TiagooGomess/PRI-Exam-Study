# Entity-oriented Search

## What is entity-oriented search? What is necessary to implement it?

-   Entity-Oriented Search is the search paradigm of organizing and accessing information centered around entities, and their attributed and relationships.
-   From a user perspective, entities are natural units for organizing information. Allowing users to interact with specific entities offers a richer and more effective user experience than what is provided by conventional document-based retrieval systems.
-   From a machine perspective, entities allow for a better understanding of search queries, of document content, and even of users. Entities enable search engines to be more effective.
